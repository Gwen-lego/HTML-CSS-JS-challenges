### What I learned

WI found icons in white color hard to find so i looked into app or ways to change colors on a png or jpeg.
I found a generator to convert from balck color to any other color. Thanks to Barrett Sonntag who created it and shared with us.

Enter the color wanted and it gives you the filter to apply:
```css
 .twitter, .facebook, .instagram {
      filter: invert(100%) sepia(100%) saturate(0%) hue-rotate(59deg) brightness(103%) contrast(106%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Color filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This can help you changing color of an icon or item taht you could not find in the color you wanted.
