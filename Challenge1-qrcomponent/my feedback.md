## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The use of Rem and em to create a more responsive website &

How to center an element vertically and horizontally within the browser using Flexbox:
```css
  body {
      min-height: 100vh;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      font-size: 1em; /* 1em represent 16px, if we change the default font-size to 18px, 1em will adjust automatically to 18px, it's variable */
    }
```
